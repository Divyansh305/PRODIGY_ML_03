Task 3: Cat vs. Dog Classification

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs. Dogs dataset. The objective is to preprocess the dataset, train an SVM model, and evaluate its performance on image classification tasks.
Project Overview

The Cats vs. Dogs dataset consists of a large collection of images, which are processed to prepare them for classification. The project follows these key steps:

    Data Preparation: Downloading and preprocessing the dataset.
    Model Training: Training an SVM classifier on a subset of the images.
    Model Evaluation: Testing the trained model on sample images to demonstrate its classification capabilities.

Key Features

    SVM Classifier: Implementation of an SVM model for image classification.
    Data Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and conversion of images for training.
    Performance Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy on test images.
